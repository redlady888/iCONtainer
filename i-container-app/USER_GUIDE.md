## Features in Detail

### Food Spoilage Detection

The core functionality of the i-CONtainer app is the food spoilage detection tool, which simulates how the real product would analyze gases emitted by food to determine freshness.

#### How to Use:

1. **Select Food Type**:
   - Click on one of the food type buttons (Meat, Eggs, Dairy, Fruits, Vegetables, Rice)
   - Each food type has different spoilage thresholds for various gases

2. **Adjust Sensor Readings**:
   - Use the sliders to set values for:
     - CO₂ (Carbon Dioxide) - measured in ppm (parts per million)
     - NH₃ (Ammonia) - measured in ppm
     - H₂S (Hydrogen Sulfide) - measured in ppm
     - VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds) - measured in ppb (parts per billion)

3. **Analyze Results**:
   - Click the "Analyze Food Status" button
   - View the traffic light indicator:
     - Green: Fresh - Food is safe to consume
     - Yellow: Warning - Early signs of spoilage, consume soon
     - Red: Spoiled - Food has spoiled and should not be consumed
   - Review detailed gas readings with color-coded status indicators
   - Examine the gas levels visualization chart

   - Toggle notifications for low battery warnings

3. **Sensor Calibration**:
   - Calibrate sensors with the "Calibrate Sensors" button
   - This simulates the calibration process that would be performed on a real device

## Tips and Tricks

1. **Testing Different Scenarios**:
   - Try different combinations of gas values to see how they affect the spoilage status
   - Each food type has different thresholds, so the same gas values may produce different results

2. **Mobile Usage**:
   - On mobile devices, the sidebar may be collapsed by default
   - Click the menu icon in the top-left corner to expand it

3. **Payment Simulation**:
   - The payment process is a simulation and doesn't process real payments
   - Use the provided test credit card number (4242 4242 4242 4242) for testing

## Troubleshooting
